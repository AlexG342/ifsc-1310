    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement was created when Steve Champeon and Nick Finck wanted to create a new way to do web development. A new method that can let any website to have  availability to all the content. It'll basically try and help every web developer to have the same amount of content. It also helps set up a method of creating a website and helps plan out how to start. You will most likely start off by creating a base html script that pretty much every website would have. Then you'll proceed with CSS to try and give your website a proper design. Finally with Javascript you can finish it up by adding so many different types of designs and tools that can help your website pop out more. They wanted to make sure that no matter the device that the website would always look good for everyone and have no need to degrade it for a certain device. I feel like this was a great idea for the future especially when we have so many different types of devices available. We have tablets,laptops,phones and many more and it's much nicer to have a website to look the same for all of these devices. There are also easier methods that were created to make any website fit any device.</p>
