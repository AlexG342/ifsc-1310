    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement was created when Steve Champeon and Nick Finck wanted to create a new way to do web development. A new method that can let any website to have  availability to all the content. It'll basically try and help every web developer to have the same amount of content. It also helps set up a method of creating a website and helps plan out how to start. You will most likely start off by creating a base html script that pretty much every website would have. Then you'll proceed with CSS to try and give your website a proper design. Finally with Javascript you can finish it up by adding so many different types of designs and tools that can help your website pop out more. They wanted to make sure that no matter the device that the website would always look good for everyone and have no need to degrade it for a certain device. I feel like this was a great idea for the future especially when we have so many different types of devices available. We have tablets,laptops,phones and many more and it's much nicer to have a website to look the same for all of these devices. There are also easier methods that were created to make any website fit any device.</p>
    <h3>Feedback and Reflection on course</h3>
    <p>For my revision I asked my older brother and one of my coworkers at my job and they both agreed that there should be a contact button at the top instead of the bottom where I placed it. They also told me to put an image on the banner which I agreed with, but I was having a lot of trouble of figuring out how to place it. I would place it, but it would look transparent and not fit the header size.I also tried to make my own feedback and tried to make it look nicer, but I was still having trouble with certain things such as making backgrounds and getting the paragraphs and list in the history page to look better. My time during this course was not what I expected honestly. I have never done any type of coding and have never really seen anything when it comes to web development so I came in this class with absouletly no knowledge at all. As the time went I thought that I would not be able to do too well in the class, but I was completely wrong. I was able to follow the class pretty well and although I still do have some issues when it comes to coding, I still believe that I still learned a lot. I've enjoyed my time as well with all the projects and assignments we wokred on during this semester. Compared to other projects you would do for other classes these were actually fun to do. I feel like I was actually accomplishing something and was happy to see how much I was able to do. The class overall was such a big enjoyment that it even got me to change my major. I would also like to thank you Professor Wallace for making the class enjoyable and easier to follow. A lot of times I feel like teachers expect you to know a lot of what is being taught, but you made it fair and easy for even a new comer like me to not be afraid of all the new lessons we were being taught. I hope to be able to learn more about web devlopment and web design as my years at UALR go by. </p>
